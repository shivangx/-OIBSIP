    <h1>About Dubai</h1>
    <p>Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking tourism. Because of its large expatriate population, it feels like a Middle Eastern melting pot, and the atmosphere is generally tolerant. Religious affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life
      Dubai is a relatively crime-free place where administrative efficiency and openness to business have encouraged astounding growth. However, criticism of Dubaiâ€™s authoritarian government and ruling elite is not tolerated, and there persists an atmosphere of discreet corruption.
